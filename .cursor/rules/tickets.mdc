# Ticket Processing Rules

These rules apply to the processing of bug and feature tickets located in the `/tickets` directory.

## 1. Ticket Lifecycle & Management
- **NEVER DELETE** a ticket file.
- To complete a ticket, change its status to `Done` or `Completed`. do not remove the file.

## 2. Ticket Structure Requirements
Every ticket file must contain the following sections:
- **Title**: A clear and concise summary of the issue or feature.
- **Status**: The current state (e.g., `Draft`, `Open`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of the requirement or bug.
- **Technical Solution**: (Required for refinement) A proposed technical implementation plan. 
    - This section MUST be added/completed during the refinement phase before any code is written.

## 3. Editing Context Constraints
- When asked to **edit**, **refine**, or **plan** a ticket:
  - **DO NOT** modify any source code files (`src/*`, etc.) or files outside of the `/tickets` folder.
  - Your sole output should be the updated content of the ticket file(s).
  - Focus on analyzing the codebase to fill out the "Technical Solution" section effectively, but do not apply changes yet.

## 4. Implementation Phase
- Only proceed to implementation (editing code files) when the ticket has a defined "Technical Solution" and you are explicitly asked to implement it.
